#This is the main function that will read all of the other subfunctions

#As of right now (April 15) this function is a skelleton and not a
# functional script. Futher work will need to be completed once
# milestone "Sub Function Definitions" is completed.

    #A32 will sum up the pressure drops and then format the data in a
    #.json that can read back into Electron
